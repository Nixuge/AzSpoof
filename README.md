# AzSpoof
A simple 1.9.4 Forge mod to make Funcraft & other servers think you're on the AZ Launcher.

# What are Funcraft and the AZ Launcher
Funcraft is a (1.9.4) French server, and the AZ Launcher is their dedicated launcher. It's not needed to play on Funcraft, and indeed 1.9.0->1.11.2 clients work just about fine, but it's greatly pushed and can improve the gameplay experience a bit.

# What can you do with the AZ Launcher
For most parts, it's just a normal Minecraft launcher like Lunar or Badlion, but this time in 1.9.4.

There are however some games (Rush 1vs1, Octogone) that can ONLY be played with that launcher for no apparent reason, apart from to push it unreasonably.

# Why not play on it then?
- Limited set of mods, and like in some other launchers you can't add any more, so if you have a specific need you basically can't do much except playing on another launcher.
- Sometimes buggy, not that buggy but has some quite annoying glitches while PVPing, which is basically the main point of using the launcher.
- (my personal reason) Horrendous input issues on 1.9.4 (especially on Linux), which make the launcher basically unusable for anything against an even mid-good player.

# Why release that mod now ?
Had it for quite a while but basically just forgot about it, now that Funcraft is closing in a month (28 august 2023) might as well release it

# Usage
The mod is really primitive, it doesn't save any config or anything.

Use /azspoof to toggle on/off the mod (by default disabled when launching mc).

This mod is basically useless if not playing "Octogone" or "Rush 1vs1"
